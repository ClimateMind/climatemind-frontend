According to the National Institute of Mental Health, \u201csuicide was the second leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 10 and 34\u201d, and the rates continue to climb. Studies have found that suicide rates increase by 0.7 percent in the United States when there is 1 degree Celsius of warming. Given the warming trends from our continued emissions of heat-trapping gases, Stanford researchers found \u201cup to 21,000 additional suicides will occur by 2050 within the United States and Mexico\u201d if significant action is not taken. A European study conducted in 2016 found climatic indicators to be a better predictor of suicide than socioeconomic factors after studying 29 countries over 13 years.\n\nStudies have found heat waves have the ability to affect our capacity to regulate our emotions, leading to other mental health issues such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder in addition to suicide. Combatting these psychological effects is a national concern and requires serious investments in money and time. The Integrated Benefits Institute found that \u201cfor every 1,000 US employees, mood disorders in the workforce cost about $232,000 in excess health care treatments and lost work time\u201d. Notably, availability of air conditioners does not prevent the impacts of heat on suicide. In addition to increased funding for suicide prevention, hospitals and other organizations can work to disseminate information on building individual resiliency behaviors. Investing in these preventative measures and addressing climate change could save thousands of lives from suicide alone.",

    "effectDescription": "Global warming has caused an increase in physical violence and conflict. For example, lower water reserves and agricultural yields result from a warming planet, forcing people to choose between migration or competition for resources. A study published in Nature estimates \u201cclimate has influenced between 3% and 20% of armed conflict risk over the last century\u201d. And David Wallace-Wells claims, \u201cfor every half of a degree of warming, societies will see between 10 and 20 increase in the likelihood of armed conflict\u201d. Other researchers, such as Solomon Hsiang and Marshall Burke, have tried to quantify the relationship between climate change and conflict, finding that \u201ceach rise in temperature or extreme rainfall by one standard variation increased the frequency of interpersonal violence by 4% and intergroup conflict by 14%.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon has even recognized the severity of this issue, warning Congress that it poses a national security issue. According to their staff it is a \u201cthreat multiplier\u201d because climate change exacerbates the amount of violence surrounding existing threats such as hunger, poverty, and war. People's temperaments are more prone to be anxious and hostile at higher temperatures, where it becomes more difficult to make rational decisions. This is why increased temperatures are the leading cause of conflict in human interaction. As David-Wallace wells notes in his book, \"Heat frays everything. It increases violent crime rates, swearing on social media, and the likelihood that a major-league pitcher, coming to the mound after his teammate has been hit by a pitch, will hit an opposing batter in retaliation. The hotter it gets, the longer drivers will honk their horns in frustration; and even in simulations, police officers are more likely to fire on intruders when the exercises are conducted in hotter weather. By 2099, one speculative paper tabulated climate change in the US would bring about an additional 22,000 murders, 180,000 rapes, 3.5 million assaults, and 3.76 million robberies, burglaries, and acts of larceny.\" \n\nMigration is another outcome from climate disruption that can lead to violence. The World Bank estimates if we continue burning fossil fuels unabated there could be as many as 200 million climate migrants by 2050, seeking new areas to live when their home can no longer support their family from impacts such as sea level rise, extreme heat, fires, or drought. This means one out of every 45 people would be displaced by climate change. And studies have shown humanitarian crises such as forced migration, lead to an increase in violence against women. At the same time, protection against violence diminishes. With actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, these vast migrations can be avoided by up to 80% according to the World Bank. To keep people safe, we must move society away from burning fossil fuels to avoid catastrophic climate change that increases physical violence globally.",

This means when it rains it can release more water than previously possible. Hurricanes become worse because not only can their clouds hold more water than before, warmer oceans allow hurricanes to become even larger with stronger wind speeds, and enables them to sit on top of cities for longer periods of time. Additionally, climate change is making our usual weather cycles more unusual and unpredictable, meaning that both dry seasons and wet seasons will be intensified. Additionally, sea level rise driven by melting ice caps is flooding coastal areas. All of these mean that once in a lifetime events like droughts, hurricanes, and floods are becoming increasingly common events, and will overwhelm our existing infrastructure.\n\nFlooding destroys both lives and property, ruins entire crops, and causes sewage and farm runoff to contaminate living areas and water supplies. The loss of clean water supplies leads to outbreaks of usually easily preventable disease, like diarrhoeal diseases which already kill around half a million children every year.\n\nMany vulnerable areas of the United States (as well as other developed countries) are seeing significant residential and commercial development despite the long-term flood risks.  Nationally, the number of Americans living in these high-flood-risk areas in 2016 climbed 14 percent compared to those living in the same neighborhoods in 2000.

The Asparagopsis red seaweed possesses a property that helps to inhibit an enzyme in the cow\u2019s digestive system which contributes to methane production.\n\nThe latest breakthrough from the researchers is that adding seaweed to beef cattle's diets can reduce methane emissions by as much as 82 percent.

Increasing the rate of carbon taxes encourages a faster shift away from burning fossil fuels and towards practices consistent with keeping global warming limited below catastrophic levels. According to the US Congressional Budget Office, a carbon tax of just $25 per ton would cause taxed emissions to be 11% lower than projected without a tax, and generate $1 trillion by 2028. The International Monetary Fund estimates a carbon tax of $75 per ton would lead to an emissions scenario which limits global warming to levels agreed upon by the Paris Agreement (2 degrees Celsius).\n\nWith the revenue generated from increased carbon taxes, investments can be made in climate-friendly initiatives or can be returned back to consumers to make the carbon tax revenue-neutral. Technologies such as those related to clean energy and emissions reduction can develop faster and increase the speed of the transition toward a sustainable future with more government investment. Money can also be directed to assist developing nations with their emissions or help marginalized communities with adapting to climate impacts that disproportionately affect them.",
