If policies for promoting clean cooking worldwide are aggressively implemented, guided by the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of universal access to clean energy, reductions in emissions can amount to 31-73 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalents at a net cost of $128-$264 billion. These stoves do raise cooking operating costs however by $2.0-$4.2 trillion over the stove lifetimes considering that many families collect firewood for free or buy cheap fuels today. These results include the reduction of black carbon, the second more impactful climate pollutant, by 8-20 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalents.

Each 1.8Â° Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) of warming reduces growth by 1% on average. One reason for this is an increased frequency of heat waves and extreme temperatures.\n\nHeat affects people's ability to concentrate and their health, causing lower labor productivity and employee absenteeism, which in turn affect the success of companies and their contribution to the economy. Studies indicate an average 2% decrease in work performance per Â°C temperature rise (1.8Â° F) when the temperature is above 25Â°C (77Â°F). \n\nIThe frequency of intense heat waves (4-day, 1-in-5 year events) has generally increased since the 1960s in most regions. In 2019, heatwave related health care costs alone were $3.8 trillion. It's projected that heatwaves will lead to a $2 trillion loss in labor productivity by 2030.\n\nAdditionally, marine heatwaves damage and kill coral reefs (which are worth $36 billion a year to the world economy), affecting tourism and the fishing industry and further contributing to the decline in GDP.\n\nIf appropriate adaptation and mitigation measures aren't taken, as global temperatures continue to rise we can expect a 7.2% cut to GDP per person worldwide and a 10.5% cut in the USA by 2100.

Project Drawdown assumes that as regenerative annual cropping becomes more widely used, farms that have already adopted conservation agriculture will convert to these more effective soil fertility practices in response to consumer demand for fewer harmful herbicides. The benefits of that conversion are counted by the regenerative annual cropping solution. Nonetheless, conservation agriculture offers significant benefits in the interim, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 13.4-9.4 gigatons based on average carbon sequestration rates of 0.25- 0.78 tons of carbon per hectare per year, depending on region. Establishment costs are low at $91.9-65.2 billion with a lifetime operational savings of $2.8-1.9 trillion and lifetime net profit of $113.1-77.7 billion.",

Half the world's reef systems have already been destroyed.\n\nCoral reefs have the highest biodiversity of all marine ecosystems on the planet. They are important habitats for many fish species. Many people also highly value coral reefs for their beauty.  Corals come in a rich array of colours and shapes, and shelter a wide range of marine life from sea turtles to brightly-coloured clownfish and angelfish. Parrotfish graze on the reefs themselves, producing the fine white sand characteristic of tropical beaches.\n\nReefs are also valuable fishery grounds and tourist destinations. They help protect coastlines from erosion and storms. So as well as being of high intrinsic value, the loss of coral reefs threatens economies and leads to property damage.\n\nUnder climate change, marine heatwaves have doubled since 1982.

Establishing tree plantations on an additional 112-174 million hectares of marginal lands can sequester 22.2-35.9 gigatons of carbon dioxide by 2050. The use of marginal lands for afforestation also indirectly avoids deforestation that otherwise would be done in the conventional system. At an initial cost of cost of $17-72 billion and lifetime operational cost of $164.8-259.5 billion to implement, this additional area of timber plantations could produce a lifetime net profit of $2.1-3.4 trillion.",

Multiple layers of trees and crops achieve high rates of both carbon sequestration and food production. Multistrata agroforestry can be integrated into some existing agricultural systems; others can be converted or restored to it. If adopted on another 39-66 million hectares by 2050, from 100 million hectares currently, 11.3-20.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide could be sequestered. Average sequestration rate of 4.45 tons of carbon per hectare per year is strong, as is financial return: $1.7-3 trillion lifetime, on a $54-92 billion initial investment and lifetime operational cost of $142.9-245.4.",

Managing leaks and disposal of these chemicals can avoid emissions in buildings and landfills. Substantial emissions reductions could be achieved through the adoption of practices to (1) avoid leaks from refrigerants and (2) destroy refrigerants at end of life, both after the adoption of alternatives to HFC refrigerants. Over thirty years, an increase of over 79% percent of refrigerants that may be released can be contained, avoiding emissions equivalent to 57.8 gigatons of carbon dioxide. Although some revenue can be generated from resale of recovered refrigerant gases, the costs to establish and operate recovery, destruction, and leak avoidance outweigh the financial benefitâ€”meaning that refrigerant management, as modeled, could incur a net cost of $629.4 billion by 2050.",
