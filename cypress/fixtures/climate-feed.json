As of 2018, clean cookstoves were used by over 53% of families in developing regions with the rest using open wood or charcoal fires for cooking, with concomitant health and environmental effects. If policies for promoting clean cooking worldwide are aggressively implemented, guided by the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of universal access to clean energy, reductions in emissions can amount to 31-73 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalents at a net cost of $128-$264 billion. These stoves do raise cooking operating costs however by $2.0-$4.2 trillion over the stove lifetimes considering that many families collect firewood for free or buy cheap fuels today. These results include the reduction of black carbon, the second more impactful climate pollutant, by 8-20 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalents.

      "effectDescription": "Gross Domestic Profit (GDP) is a measure of the health of the economy. GDP is already significantly smaller than it could be due to the effects of global warming. Each 1.8° Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) of warming reduces growth by 1% on average. One reason for this is an increased frequency of heat waves and extreme temperatures.\n\nHeat affects people's ability to concentrate and their health, causing lower labor productivity and employee absenteeism, which in turn affect the success of companies and their contribution to the economy. Studies indicate an average 2% decrease in work performance per °C temperature rise (1.8° F) when the temperature is above 25°C (77°F). \n\nIThe frequency of intense heat waves (4-day, 1-in-5 year events) has generally increased since the 1960s in most regions. In 2019, heatwave related health care costs alone were $3.8 trillion. It's projected that heatwaves will lead to a $2 trillion loss in labor productivity by 2030.\n\nAdditionally, marine heatwaves damage and kill coral reefs (which are worth $36 billion a year to the world economy), affecting tourism and the fishing industry and further contributing to the decline in GDP.\n\nIf appropriate adaptation and mitigation measures aren't taken, as global temperatures continue to rise we can expect a 7.2% cut to GDP per person worldwide and a 10.5% cut in the USA by 2100. Taking action now to cut emissions in line with the international Paris agreement could limit the loss to 1.1%, helping to protect the economy and people's livelihoods.",

These majestic creatures have evolved to live in colder climates. As heatwaves become more frequent and severe, these animals become heat-stressed and have access to less suitable habitat. By 2050, the total habitat for all mammals is expected to decline globally by 5%–16% of the 2015 level. This can be seen in Minnesota, where a decrease in moose population from 4,000 in 1983 to 100 in 2008 coincided with an average temperature increase of 3 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nIn addition to reduced habitat, warmer temperatures have enabled the increase in winter ticks. Moose have been found with 50,000 to 70,000 ticks (ten to twenty times more than normal). Ticks weaken the moose and leave them more susceptible to disease. As temperatures continue to rise, viewing and hunting opportunities will continue to decrease. Without intervention we could soon see the loss of this big-game animal.",

Over thirty years, an increase of over 79% percent of refrigerants that may be released can be contained, avoiding emissions equivalent to 57.8 gigatons of carbon dioxide. Although some revenue can be generated from resale of recovered refrigerant gases, the costs to establish and operate recovery, destruction, and leak avoidance outweigh the financial benefit—meaning that refrigerant management, as modeled, could incur a net cost of $629.4 billion by 2050.",
