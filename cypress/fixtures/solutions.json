If use is instead managed to decline more slowly by 2050 or even rise slightly to 35 percent, this solution can save 7.5-23 gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions from cars. Consumers would save $2.1-6.6 trillion in mobility costs. Project Drawdown analysis includes diverse public transit options (bus, metro, tram, and commuter rail) and examines the costs that travelers pay (car purchase and use compared to buying transit tickets).",

The combination improves fuel economy—more miles on a gallon—and lowers emissions. \nUnder some business-as-usual projections, 23 million hybrid vehicles will be in operation in 2050, less than 1 percent of the car market. Project Drawdown estimates growth in 2050 could reach 236-621 million hybrid vehicles. Until then, hybrid cars can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 4.6-7.9 gigatons by 2050, saving owners $3.0-6.1 trillion in fuel and operating costs over the lifetime of the cars.This would cost an additional $1.6-3.4 trillion in net costs.",

It cuts down on travel—especially flying—and its emissions. By avoiding emissions from business air travel, telepresence can reduce emissions by 1-3.8 gigaton of carbon dioxide over thirty years. That result assumes that over 486-676 million business-related trips are replaced by telepresence in 2050. For organizations, the investment of $87-301 billion in telepresence systems pays off with $1.2 -4.4 trillion worth of business travel savings and 107-143 billion fewer unproductive travel hours.",
