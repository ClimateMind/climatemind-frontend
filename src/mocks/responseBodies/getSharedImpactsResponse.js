        effectDescription: "Corals depend on symbiotic algae (small marine 'plants' which live inside the corals) for energy. Global warming causes increases in ocean temperatures, which increase the frequency of marine heatwaves. These high temperatures stress corals and cause them to release the algae, so the corals become colourless and will die without algae. Half the world's reef systems have already been destroyed.\n\nCoral reefs have the highest biodiversity of all marine ecosystems on the planet. They are important habitats for many fish species. Many people also highly value coral reefs for their beauty. Corals come in a rich array of colours and shapes, and shelter a wide range of marine life from sea turtles to brightly-coloured clownfish and angelfish. Parrotfish graze on the reefs themselves, producing the fine white sand characteristic of tropical beaches.\n\nReefs are also valuable fishery grounds and tourist destinations. They help protect coastlines from erosion and storms. So as well as being of high intrinsic value, the loss of coral reefs threatens economies and leads to property damage.\n\nUnder climate change, marine heatwaves have doubled since 1982. If CO2 emissions aren't reduced, in the future these heatwaves will occur 50 times more often than they do today. To protect our valuable coral reef systems, we need to act to reduce emissions now.",

Corals are increasingly turning white and dying as they expel the algae that contributes to their vibrant color and provides 90% of their energy source.",

Studies show that as temperatures rise, our brain functions slow down. College students taking identical exams had an 11% lower chance of passing when the temperature was 90 degrees Fahrenheit compared to 72 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nAir conditioning is a potential solution, but comes with its own challenges. For many people around the world air conditioning is unaffordable. For example, 87% of homes in the US have air conditioning compared to only 5% of homes in India. Even within the US access to air conditioning is not evenly distributed throughout society. School districts in wealthy areas have money to afford air conditioning, improving the test scores of their students and widening the education gap. Even with equitable air conditioning, the electrical consumption, and therefore greenhouse gas emissions, of more air conditioners need to be considered. Deploying solutions which fight climate change will help educate the students of tomorrow and allow them to achieve their goals and contribute to society.",

        effectDescription: "A hotter climate will mean more frequent and severe flooding, affecting all cities and land which experience rain or are by the sea.\n\nEvery 1°F rise in average temperature allows the air to hold 4% more water. This means when it rains it can release more water than previously possible. Hurricanes become worse because not only can their clouds hold more water than before, warmer oceans allow hurricanes to become even larger with stronger wind speeds, and enables them to sit on top of cities for longer periods of time. Additionally, climate change is making our usual weather cycles more unusual and unpredictable, meaning that both dry seasons and wet seasons will be intensified. Additionally, sea level rise driven by melting ice caps is flooding coastal areas. All of these mean that once in a lifetime events like droughts, hurricanes, and floods are becoming increasingly common events, and will overwhelm our existing infrastructure.\n\nFlooding destroys both lives and property, ruins entire crops, and causes sewage and farm runoff to contaminate living areas and water supplies. The loss of clean water supplies leads to outbreaks of usually easily preventable disease, like diarrhoeal diseases which already kill around half a million children every year.\n\nMany vulnerable areas of the United States (as well as other developed countries) are seeing significant residential and commercial development despite the long-term flood risks.",
