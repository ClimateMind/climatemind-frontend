        solutionDescription: "Various technologies and operational practices can lower airplane emissions to some degree. They include better engines, wingtips, and light weighting to improve fuel efficiency. Project Drawdown's analysis focuses on adoption of the latest and most fuel-efficient aircraft; retrofitting existing aircraft with winglets, newer engines, and lighter interiors; and retiring older aircraft early. Over thirty years, and for a net cost of $830-850 billion, 6.3-9.2 gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions can be avoided, saving $2.5-3.6 trillion on lifetime jet-fuel and operating costs. Other efficiency measures could provide additional emissions reductions and savings as over 80 percent of aircraft are converted.",

        solutionDescription: "To produce new products from recovered materials requires fewer raw resources and less energy. That’s how recycling household, commercial, and industrial waste can cut emissions. The household and industrial recycling solutions were modeled together and include metals, plastic, glass, and other materials, such as rubber, textiles, and e-waste. Paper products and organic wastes are treated in separate waste management solutions. Emissions reductions stem from avoiding emissions associated with landfilling and from substituting recycled materials for virgin feedstock. With about 50 percent of recycled materials coming from households and rest from industry, if the average worldwide recycling rate increases to 65-68 percent of total recyclable waste, household recycling could avoid 5.5-6.0 gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050.",

        solutionDescription: "Huge volumes of goods are shipped across oceans. Fuel-saving ship design, onboard technologies, and operational practices can improve efficiency and trim emissions. A combination of a selection of 17 ship technologies with slow steaming (literally slowing the ship speed) can help reduce fuel consumption of ocean ships of a variety of types. This fuel reduction can be on the order of 50% of today’s consumption rates across the international shipping industry, and if adoption grows to 57-78 percent of international ships, can lead to a 4.4-6.3 gigaton reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 at cost of $530-733 billion. That could save $620-876 billion in fuel costs over the life of the ships.",
