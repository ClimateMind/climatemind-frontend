  longDescription:
    "Tourism supports the livelihoods of an estimated one in ten people worldwide andaround 80% occurs around coastal destinations. Coral reefs are popular and exciting places for sightseeing, swimming, snorkelling, diving and boating. For example, Australia's Great Barrier Reef annually attracts 1.9 million visits, generates AUD$5.4 billion from tourism and supports 54,000 jobs. Florida's Coral Reef has an annual estimated tourism value of $1.1 billion and supports 71,000 jobs.\n\nWarming oceans due to climate change are causing increases in heatwaves occurring in the ocean (marine heatwaves). The frequency of these marine heatwaves has doubled since 1982, increasing coral bleaching and destruction. Already over 50% of coral reefs have been lost. If yearly CO2 emissions aren't reduced, in the future these heatwaves will occur 50 times more often than they do today, causing over 97% of all coral reefs to die off along with much of the coastal marine life they support. The loss of coral reefs makes coastal destinations less attractive to tourists and negatively affects local economies.",
