  longDescription:
    "Various technologies and operational practices can lower airplane emissions to some degree. They     include better engines, wingtips, and light weighting to improve fuel efficiency. Project Drawdown's analysis focuses on adoption of the latest and most fuel-efficient aircraft; retrofitting existing aircraft with winglets, newer engines, and lighter interiors; and retiring older aircraft early. Over thirty years, and for a net cost of $830-850 billion, 6.3-9.2 gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions can be avoided, saving $2.5-3.6 trillion on lifetime jet-fuel and operating costs. Other efficiency measures could provide additional emissions reductions and savings as over 80 percent of aircraft are converted.",
