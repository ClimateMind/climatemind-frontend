        and store your information. We may use cookies and similar tracking
        technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store
        information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and

        <Typography variant="h4" id="6">
          6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
        </Typography>
        In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill
        the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required
        by law. We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is

        legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will
        either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible
        (for example, because your personal information has been stored in
        backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information
        and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

        despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no
        electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage
        technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or
        guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third
        parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect,
        access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best
        to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
        information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only
        access the Website within a secure environment.

        processing before its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of

        grounds other than consent. If you are a resident in the European

        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
        activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
        online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
        uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
        has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
        signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

        of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided
        below, and include the email address associated with your account and a
